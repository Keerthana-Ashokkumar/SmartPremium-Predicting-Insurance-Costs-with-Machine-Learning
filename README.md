"SmartPremium: Predicting Insurance Costs with Machine Learning"

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting insurance premium amounts using machine learning techniques based on customer demographic, lifestyle, and financial attributes. The system integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web application for real-time premium prediction.

🏫 Domain

Data Science / Machine Learning

❓ Problem Statement

Insurance companies face challenges in accurately estimating premium amounts due to multiple influencing factors such as age, income, health habits, and policy details. A predictive, data-driven system is required to automate premium calculation, reduce manual effort, and improve pricing consistency.

💼 Business Use Cases

Predict insurance premium for new customers Identify high-risk customers based on input features Assist insurance agents in decision-making Improve transparency in premium calculation Enable quick what-if analysis for customers
